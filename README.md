# dnunlocked
Simple chrome extension to give user access to locked articles and removing ads from DN.se

### Note: 
This extension is deprecated since the website(Dagens nyheter) has updated it's security policy to secure it's content in a more robust way. This is probably a good thing for their business, but bad news for this extension. I will leave the code here as is, but I have removed the extension from the chrome web store.
